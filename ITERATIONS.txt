Iteration 1
-----------

Get Rails app up and running

Get basic model in place:
    Location (restaurant/pub)
    City (town/city/village)
    Dish (menu item reviewed)

as in, I ate Dish at Location in City.

Check all is well, 'rake test'

Iteration 2

    Location needs a name, should be simple
    City needs a name, name should be unique (or should it?!)
    Dish needs a name

Investigate and set up unit test framework
