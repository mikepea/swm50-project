Iteration 1
-----------

Get Rails app up and running

Get basic model in place:
    Location (restaurant/pub)
    City (town/city/village)
    Dish (menu item reviewed)

as in, I ate Dish at Location in City.

Check all is well, 'rake test'

Iteration 2
-----------

Add validation to model
    Location needs a name, should be simple
    City needs a name, name should be unique (or should it?!)
    Dish needs a name

Investigate and set up unit test framework


Iteration 3
-----------

Create front page: find a roast, rate your roast

Add basic login/logout functionality


Iteration 4
-----------

Add ability to add a description to a location, but must be able to back out changes.
